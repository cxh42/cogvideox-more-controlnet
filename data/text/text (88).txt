The video shows a man sitting on a bench in front of a building. The camera then pans to the right, showing a blue structure with the word "autodesk" written on it. The structure appears to be a large metal container or shipping container that has been repurposed as an office or workspace. The area surrounding the structure is landscaped with small trees and bushes, and there are several parked cars visible in the background.

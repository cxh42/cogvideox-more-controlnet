The video shows a flooded street in front of a building. The water is very high, reaching up to the doors of the building. The street is completely submerged, and there are no cars or people visible. The water appears to be still, with no visible current or movement. The scene is quite eerie and unsettling, with the flooded street creating a sense of isolation and abandonment.
